About me
======
Welcome! 

I am Ph.D. student at CityU. 

My research interests include point cloud compression and processing.

Before CityU, I received my M.Sc. at SIAT & UCAS, focusing on subjective and objective quality evaluation of point clouds.

Outside of my work, I am a big fan of badminton.
